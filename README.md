# Flowerbox Delivery

Fresh cut code testing flowers, delivered straight to your door!

This component of Flowerbox uses Sprockets to compile your test suite's code into a nice package,
then delivers it to a runner in two ways:

* Straight on the filesystem, the absolute fastest way to run your tests
* Through a Rack server, so you can teest things that need a real HTTP url, like history and WebWorkers

## Installation
